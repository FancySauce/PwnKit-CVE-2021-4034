# Pwnkit Exploit Instructions

I did not write this.  This is only to document my exection/instruction of exploit use as there are some very intricate and complicated steps to follow.  

Files come from the following source:
https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165739/PolicyKit-1-0.105-31-Privilege-Escalation.html

Additional assistance on execution found here:

This was tested/executed on OSCP's Blackgate Practice VM:
	Ubuntu 20.04
	Kernel 5.8.0-63-generic
	
	
How to know if vulnerable:

Check for available SUID and make sure `/usr/bin/pkexec` is a SUID binary:
 `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`
 
Check permissions of the binary:
`ls -al /usr/bin/pkexec`

Check pkexec version:

`/usr/bin/pkexec --version`

Vulnerable version found on Blackgate: `pkexec version 0.105`

Make sure compiler is available on the victim machine.
`gcc version`
	
# Exploit Execution

Copy the files over to the vicitm machine (Makefile, evil-so.c, exploit.c)
And compile using 'make all' command.
Execute './exploit'

Check shell
